							<p>
								You may ask yourself what are the UN SDG's? Well UN SDG's are the goals that the United Nations created to make a better earth. These goals are devoted to improve the life of people, of animals,and the health of the earth. Un SDG goals stand for "United Nations Sustainable development goals. The two goals that I have chose are Climate Action and Life below Water.

							<p>
								Life under water has been declining over the past 10 years. In the past 10 years the amount of plastic that is being produced and thrown away. In 2020 there is around 5.25 trillion pieces of macro and micro pieces of plastic in this world. In the middle of the Pacific Ocean there is a pile of garbage that is three times the size of France. This affects the lives of many animals. For example, the turtle above has been affected by plastic pollution because it has grown with the plastic caught on him preventing his middle section from growing. Another way that humans are affecting the Ocean is when humans pollute they are wrecking corals in the ocean. Above you can see the before and after of corals. The picture on the left is what corals look like before pollution and the picture in the middleis after pollution. These are the homes of fish and other sea creatures. As a lot of corals around the world start to disappear the populations of fish are dropping.

							</h5><img src="download-4.jpg" width="400" heig ht="235" alt="">
							<p>
							The life in the future will change drastically if humans continue affecting the oceans as we are right now. If we keep polluting and erasing coral then the amount of fish in the oceans will decrease. This is really bad because as humans we are over-fishing so there will be a very little amount of fish in the oceans. Leading to many people starving as fish is there main source of food and also this will disrupt the oceans food chain which could lead to a good amount of species to become extinct.

								Solutions
							</h2><img src="carbon%20footprint.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="">
							<p>
							There are so many possoible solutions to prevent these things but an everyday person can just do something small. Such as putting our plastic in the recycling bin or to try and use carton or paper instead of plastic. The last way you can help is by trying to minimize your carbon fooprint. If you can walk or take a bike then try doing that instead of driving.
